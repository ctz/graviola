> **Graviola** is a compendium of **high quality**,
> **fast** and **easy to build** cryptography for Rust, aimed
> at use with [rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls).

*High quality*: Graviola incorporates assembler routines
from the [s2n-bignum] project.  These have been formally proven
to be memory safe, free of side channels (at the architectural level),
and to correctly implement the desired mathematical operation.

*Fast*: Graviola beats or is competitive with other cryptography
libraries for Rust.  See [performance comparison][performance].

*Easy and fast to build*: no C compiler, assembler or other tooling
needed: just the Rust compiler.  Compiles in less than one second.

## Status

Active development.  Do not use.  Currently external contributions
are not welcomed; please do not file issues or PRs.

## Goals

- [x] Fast and simple compilation
    - [x] `cargo build` takes less than one second, and requires only rustc
- [x] Competitive performance (with *ring*, aws-lc-rs, and rustcrypto)
- [x] Uses formally-verified assembler from other projects (where available)
- [x] Intended to provide algorithms in wide use on web
- [x] Intended for use as a rustls `CryptoProvider`

## Limitations

`aarch64` and `x86_64` architectures only.

- `aarch64` requires `aes`, `sha2`, `pmull`, and `neon` CPU features.
- `x86_64` requires `aes`, `ssse3` `avx`, `avx2`, `bmi2`, and `pclmulqdq` CPU features.

## Assorted technical details

### RSA
All the arithmetic is provided by s2n-bignum.

The RSA private operation always uses the CRT optimisation.

Modular exponentiation uses 4-bit fixed exponent window, and the term is selected by
the exponent bits from the table of base powers in a side-channel-free way.
The private operation is always followed by the public operation to verify the result
(and the result compared in a side-channel-free way).

Only RSA signing and verification are provided.  Our policy on RSA encryption is:
"These are not made. They should never be made. We will not make them. We will not help make them."

### ECC
All ECC field and scalar arithmetic are provided by s2n-bignum.

P256 base point multiplication uses 7-bit exponent window in wNAF form (this costs a 148KB constant table).
Variable point multiplication uses a 5-bit exponent window in wNAF form.

P384 base and variable point multiplication both use a 5-bit exponent window in wNAF form.
(This means we're leaving a some P384 base point performance on the table, in exchange for code space.
P384 performance seems to be less important than P256.)

ECDSA follows RFC6979 for generation of `k`, but adds additional non-critical random input.
We do this to avoid the theoretical fragility of RFC6979 under fault conditions.
This is allowed for by RFC6979, and the HMAC-DRBG that it builds on.
The code is structured such that we pass the RFC6979 test vectors.

The code which selects a term from a table of points is non-verified,
and is written in AVX2/Neon intrinsics.

X25519 directly uses the s2n-bignum implementation.

### Symmetric cryptography
SHA256 has straightforward implementations using hashing intrinsics
(aka "SHA-NI" on x86_64, "sha" extension on aarch64) with runtime fallback
on x86_64 to a pure Rust version if needed.

SHA384/SHA512 on x86_64 has an AVX2 by-4 implementation.

AES and GHASH always use intrinsics (there are no fallbacks).

On x86_64, we have a by-8 AES-CTR and a by-8 GHASH (they are not currently
interleaved; this is future work.)  On aarch64 we have a by-1 AES-CTR
and by-8 GHASH (also not interleaved, and I found a by-8 AES-CTR
kept spilling registers and was slower.)


## Architecture

We have broadly three module layers:

- `low`: low level primitives. private. platform-specific. unsafe allowed. `no_std`. no alloc.
- `mid`: constructions, protocols and encodings. private. platform agnostic. no unsafe. `no_std`. alloc.
- `high`: public interface, primarily a rustls `CryptoProvider`. platform agnostic. no unsafe.

`low` code should not refer to `mid`, nor `mid` to `high`.

`low` must present the same interface irrespective of platform.  To this end,
`low::generic` contains pure-rust polyfills for items we don't have assembler-
or intrinsic-based implementations for a certain platform.
